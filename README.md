# EasyEnterpriseTemplate
This repo is dedicated to a project I'm working on to create a Visual Studio multi-project solution for easy-to-read, easy-to-use, enterprise-level applications. 

# Purpose
The purpose of the Easy Enterprise Template is to provide a Visual Studio template that allows users to create enterprise solutions that accommodate a wide range of skill levels. To that end, the template should not use excess external libraries or overly complicated design patterns but should include scalable architecture and basic enterprise-level features such as:
- Secrets from Cloud-hosted secrets store
- 

# Architecture
The architecture of this project is based on Clean Architecture, consisting of the following layers:
- Presentation
- Application
- Infrastructure
- Domain
